Add the above content to a file named .gitignore in the root directory of your repository.

This .gitignore file excludes common files and directories, such as the virtual environment (venv/), editor/IDE-specific files (.vscode/, *.pyc), logs (*.log), and the dependency directory (env/).

Make sure to adjust the .gitignore file as per your specific requirements and project structure.
