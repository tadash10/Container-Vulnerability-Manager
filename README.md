        This repository contains a Python script that automates the identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities in container images, while adhering to ISO standards for container security. The script utilizes vulnerability scanning tools, applies security patches, recommends updates, implements container runtime security measures, and applies image hardening measures.
Installation

To use the Container Security Script, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/container-security-script.git

Change into the repository directory:

bash

cd container-security-script

(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows

Install the required dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

The Container Security Script can be used from the command line interface (CLI). Here are the available commands:

    Scan a container image for vulnerabilities:

    bash

python container_security_script.py scan <image_name>

Replace <image_name> with the name of the container image you want to scan.

Apply security patches to a container image:

bash

python container_security_script.py patch <image_name>

Replace <image_name> with the name of the container image you want to apply security patches to.

Recommend updates for a container image:

bash

python container_security_script.py recommend <image_name>

Replace <image_name> with the name of the container image you want to recommend updates for.

Perform complete vulnerability mitigation for a container image:

bash

python container_security_script.py mitigate <image_name>

Replace <image_name> with the name of the container image you want to perform vulnerability mitigation for.
